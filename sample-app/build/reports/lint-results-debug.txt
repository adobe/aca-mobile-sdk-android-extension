/Users/prazvan/work/aca-mobile-sdk-android-extension/sample-app/build.gradle.kts:13: Warning: Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. Consult the android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES javadoc for details. [OldTargetApi]
        targetSdk = 34
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "OldTargetApi":
   When your application runs on a version of Android that is more recent than
   your targetSdkVersion specifies that it has been tested with, various
   compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues
   to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the targetSdkVersion
   is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.

   To fix this issue, set the targetSdkVersion to the highest available value.
   Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to
   consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version
   you are adding support for:

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

                                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "AutoboxingStateCreation":
   Calling mutableStateOf<T>() when T is either backed by a primitive type on
   the JVM or is a value class results in a state implementation that requires
   all state values to be boxed. This usually causes an additional allocation
   for each state write, and adds some additional work to auto-unbox values
   when reading the value of the state. Instead, prefer to use a specialized
   primitive state implementation for Int, Long, Float, and Double when the
   state does not need to track null values and does not override the default
   SnapshotMutationPolicy.

/Users/prazvan/work/aca-mobile-sdk-android-extension/sample-app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:6: Warning: Should explicitly set android:icon, there is no default [MissingApplicationIcon]
    <application
     ~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "MissingApplicationIcon":
   You should set an icon for the application as whole because there is no
   default. This attribute must be set as a reference to a drawable resource
   containing the image (for example @drawable/icon).
